# Project Title
This app was created to model an easy and intuitive way to organizer one's day. I set it up to sync the Journal, "today's events", with the clicked Date. Any time the user clicks a date on the calendar, the rest of the components update themsleves based on the clicked date.
The backend uses a date range from the req.params to search through the MongoDB and retrieve the data.
