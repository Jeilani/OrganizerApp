        Today was a great day. I did everything I was suppposed to do and on time. <br/> I woke up and made sure the room was clean before
        doing anything else. After brushing my teeth and all that fun stuff, I dressed up for the gym to go hit back and legs. <br/> <br/> After coming
        back from the gym I proceeded to get all my work tools and journey off to starbucks.
